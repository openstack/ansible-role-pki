    Added variables ``pki_handler_ca_changed``, ``pki_handler_cert_changed``
    and ``pki_handler_cert_installed`` that control name of meta handlers which
    role triggers when included. This might be useful if multiple roles that
    leverage the pki role are inlcuded withing same playbook and you want to
    have better control over handler execution.
